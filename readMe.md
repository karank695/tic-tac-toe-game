# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
The ***Tic-Tac-Toe*** game project is developed using the Java programming language, incorporating *object-oriented programming (OOP)* 
concepts to ensure modularity, reusability, and maintainability of the code.The project follows a top-down approach, where the game logic is designed first, followed by the user interface implementation. This approach enables a clear separation of concerns and allows for easier testing and debugging.The game provides an interactive and engaging experience, allowing two players to compete against each other on a 3x3 grid. It handles player moves, checks for win conditions, and displays the game outcome, providing an enjoyable and challenging gaming experience.

How to test
```
* The Manager class in the Tic-Tac-Toe game code serves as the central component responsible for running the application and managing the game's processes.
* It handles the initialization of the game, including creating instances of necessary classes and setting up the game board.
* The Manager class oversees the flow of the game, ensuring that each player takes turns and making necessary calls to other classes for player moves, updating the game board, and checking for win conditions.
* It handles user input and provides appropriate prompts and messages to the players throughout the game, keeping them informed about the game state and outcomes.
* The Manager class is also responsible for terminating the game when a winner is determined or declaring a draw if no player wins.
